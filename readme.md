## Why

At first I wondered what shape will a 3-ball system form on the surface.

However, it seems that the shape of 5, 6, 7-ball system is particularly like the atom distribution of molecules. This is not surprise because the limited surface is just like the length of the chemistry bond. Because of the electronic waves trys to get avoid of each other, the bonds(electron pairs) distribution is serperated with each other, exactly like the setup of this system.
